* To create an archive:

Example: creating archive "test.sh" from the files in ./testmakeself/android/:

cd makeself-2.1.5/
./makeself.sh --notemp ../testmakeself/android/  ../test.sh "android test" ../testmakeself/startup.sh

The startup.sh is a script which is run before installation. In the eaxmple, it asks for the
confirmation to extract the files.

cd ..
./test.sh

it creates and extract the files in ./android directory
