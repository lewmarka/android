1. My changed runner:

Overrides the test runner object to get the results directly.
Overrides some methods to acto what I want. 

It works well in eclipse.


2. Running the test cases through commandline:

Create an ant project that runs everything via commandline.
Set the ant properties of the project and other properties.

> android avd (run the device)
> sudo ant clean debug install test 
debug => creates .apk package which is needed to be installed
install => installs the application on a device
test => run the test cases specified in build.xml and manifest.

Note that changing the runner in the manifest is not enough, the runner
is hard coded in sdk/tools/build.xml. Therefore, it should be changed.
